# HX71708 v0.1.0 (alpha)

## Overview

The **HX71708** library is a fork of https://github.com/RobTillaart/HX711 version 0.5.2. It is built for the **HX71708** from Avia Semiconductor (Xiamen) Ltd. using the **Arduino IDE**. 

Whereas the HX711 uses clock pulses to set gain, the HX71708 operates with a fixed gain, and uses clock pulses to set the data sample rate of 10, 20, 80, or 320 Hz. This is the only modification I have made to the code base and examples.
